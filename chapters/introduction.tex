In programs development it is very important to have an estimate of how long developing different parts of application takes as
developer work hours make up big part of application cost.
This estimate can be calculated from time spent on writing similar tasks from past.

Similarly, it is important to have general idea of how much time students spend on different subjects in university.
All subjects have some time estimate but subjects with similar time estimate still tend to be very different in actual
time needed for completion.
Therefore, a solution is needed to track actual time spent on subjects.

In subjects mostly consisting of programming exercises this can be achieved by tracking time spent on writing and testing programs.
As it is very common to use Git for code management both at universities and companies linking time tracking to git commits
gives opportunity to also have statistics such as time spent per commit and lines written per commit.

To protect source code in non-public repositories it is important to have architecture in which parts accessing code are
installed into client server and are open source so that client can ensure there is no sensible data leaked.

Due to Git being command line tool also a separate graphical application is needed for visualizing data collected
from Git projects.

\section{Project scope - v siis kuidas on ülesande püstitus inglise keeles}\label{sec:project-scope}
The scope of this project consists of three main parts.
The goal of a first phase is to have a working app to track and save programmers time.
The second phase focuses on collecting the data together and storing it in a more accessible format.
The third phase is to visualize collected data to both lecturers and students.

This project is developed to be used in university, but the goal is not to tie it tightly together.
Rather it is supposed to be an application that could be later easily used for also personal and work projects.

All the apps that are installed on client machine / server are open source so that their user can easily reassure in their safety.
Parts of program, that are not hosted on client machine are kept private for now.
