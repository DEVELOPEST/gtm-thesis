Prior to the actual development, the general project framework was sey up:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The roles and responsibilities were split.
    \item The rules and agreements on developing methodology were made.
    \item Environments were set up
\end{itemize}

It was agreed that Tavo Annus is responsible for DevOps and client side software.
Marten JÃ¼rgenson is responsible for backend and frontend development.
As the client side software has less work to do, Tavo will be also working on both backend and
frontend on the later half of the project.

For the project management, GitHub was chosen as it is more common for users to browse project on GitHub rather than Gitlab.
Universities personal Gitlab server was ruled out as it does not allow non-university students to easily access open source parts of our application.

As a communication channel, Discord was used for both text and sound/video communication.
The main reason was that we were both used to using Discord, it is free, and it allows reasonably well formatted code pastes / pinning.

Meetings with TalTech mentor were organized weekly on Teams to have continuous feedback on project.
