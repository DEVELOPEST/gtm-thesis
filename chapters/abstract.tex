As part of this thesis, open source time tracking system was build for Tallinn University of Technology.
The purpose of the system is to give an overview of the time put into each task and how is
this effort distributed over time.
The system is built for both lecturers and students, and it is developed in a way that it
could be also used for personal projects or companies.

The system is built around an open source app called \href{https://github.com/git-time-metric/gtm}{Git-Time-Metric}.
Now the system consists of five different applications distributed into five layers.
Two of the layers are on client machine and three are hosted in server.

As a result of this work \href{https://github.com/git-time-metric/gtm}{Git-Time-Metric} app was improved,
a plugin was built for Jetbrains' editors,
a Debian package was built for app responsible for collecting data from multiple Git repositories
and a frontend - backend combo was built for storing and visualizing data.

Deployed web app is accessible at \href{https://cs.ttu.ee/services/gtm/front}{https://cs.ttu.ee/services/gtm/front}
and rest of the applications can be found on GitHub \href{https://github.com/DEVELOPEST}{https://github.com/DEVELOPEST}.
